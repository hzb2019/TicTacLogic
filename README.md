# TicTacLogic

Final assignment involving writing ARM assembly for my Computer Organization and Architecture course. 

This is a command line version of the game Tic Tac Logic (also known as binary puzzles, among various other names).

I wrote the file tictac.S which handles displaying the game and handles game logic and win condition checks after a user input. This assignment was introducing arrays in 
assembly so it utilizes pointer math and C function calls from asm for memory allocation and freeing. It also shows a few skills learned previously in the class like 
callee-saved registers, outputting text from asm, loops, using differently sized registers, and saving and loading to variables.
